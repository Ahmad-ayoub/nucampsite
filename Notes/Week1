you can export default in the beginning of the code or page rather than at the bottom

view component is the most generic container compoent
like a div element in html

since this isn't the browser world, we won't write
in jsx anymore its just the app so everything is
written in components

<text> is a generic container for text also

it also doesn't use vanilla CSS as well, it uses a
different version of CSS meant for apps called
StyleSheet

the react view stack stacks different pages 
depending on where the screen is shown
