What is redux?
it is a predictable state container for js

it contains the methods such as 
    React redux
        Provider
        useSelector()
        useDispatch()

    Redux Toolkit
        ConfigureStore()
        createSlice()
        createAsyncThunk()
        Redux Thunk

three principles of Redux

    Single source of truth
        only one center for all the global data
    State is read-only 
        That center of data is immutable and can't be 
        modified directly, you make a copy of it and then
        modify that
    Changes are made via pure functions
